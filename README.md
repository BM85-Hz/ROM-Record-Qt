# ROM-Record

## The ultimate activity log! Never lose track of your games again!

Designed as a quick and efficient method of recording the time put into games and cataloging the resulting sessions. This desktop version was made using the Qt toolkit and is powered by Internet Games Database (IGDB) for its search features.

Start by searching a game you're looking to play and hit Start on the stopwatch when you start gaming.

Once you save the session, it'll appear in the other tabs. The calendar organizes aggregate playtime for each date and includes a note section for any additional information you'd like.
