# ReplayRecord

## The ultimate activity log! Never lose track of your games again!

Designed as a quick and efficient activity log tool for gaming sessions. This desktop version was made using the Qt toolkit and is powered by Internet Games Database (IGDB) for its search features.

Start by searching a game you're looking to play. Click on it twice to load it in and then hit Start on the stopwatch to begin logging a play session. Search results also give basic details for each game, and searching while recording a gameplay session is possible.

Once you save the session, it'll appear in the other tabs. The calendar organizes aggregate playtime for each date and includes a note section for any additional information you'd like.

The Lists tab keeps track of total playtime for all games logged in descending order as well as the 10 most recently played games.
